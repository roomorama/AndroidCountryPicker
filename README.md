The functions are simple:
 
1) Allow user to search the country

2) Inform client which country user has selected

3) Convenient function to get country  code of the selected country

## How to use

To embed CountryPicker in your own view:

```java
FragmentTransaction transaction = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
CountryPicker picker = new CountryPicker();
transaction.replace(R.id.home, picker);
transaction.commit();
```

To show CountryPicker as a dialog:

```java
CountryPicker picker = CountryPicker.newInstance("Select Country");
picker.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), "COUNTRY_PICKER");
```

When user selects a country, client can listen to that event:

```java
picker.setListener(new CountryPickerListener() {

	@Override
	public void onSelectCountry(String name, String code) {
		// Invoke your function here
	}
});
				
```
